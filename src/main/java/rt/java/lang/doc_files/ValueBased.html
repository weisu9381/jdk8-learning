      <h2>Value-based Classes</h2>
      <p>some classes,such as java.util.Optional and java.time.LocalDateTime, are value-based.</p>
      <p>Instance of a valued-based class:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>are final and immutable (though may contain references to mutable objects);</li>
          <li>have implementations of equals, hashCode, and toString which are computed solely from the instance's state and not from its identity or the state of any other object or variable;</li>
          <li>make no use of identity-sensitive operations such as reference equality (==) between instances, identity hash code of instances, or synchronization on an instances's intrinsic lock;</li>
          <li>are considered equal solely based on equals(), not based on reference equality (==);</li>
          <li>do not have accessible constructors, but are instead instantiated through factory methods which make no committment as to the identity of returned instances;</li>
          <li>are freely substitutable when equal, meaning that interchanging any two instances x and y that are equal according to equals() in any computation or method invocation should produce no visible change in behavior.</li>
